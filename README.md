# Homework 3 Question 1 by Isabella York/Jamilia Johnson/ Raquel Joseph

The code I created calls to import from another file titled “Matrices.”  In this file, I created a class called Matrices. It starts off by using variables to define the class Matrices. The variables I used were Matrix 1, Matrix 2 , and Math. I used a base of 0 for the addition of the matrices and a base of 1 for the multiplication of the matrices so that the result will be unaffected if we use 0. After importing the Matrices file, the user can then multiply, add or subtract their chosen matrices. If the user cues to multiply, the code will do just that. If the user asks to add or subtract, the code will fulfill these functions.
